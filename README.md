🫀 Heart Disease Risk Prediction Web App

💡 Project Overview:

This is a Machine Learning-powered Flask web application that predicts a person's 10-year risk of developing heart disease based on key health parameters.
The project focuses on early risk detection, giving users quick feedback through a clean, Bootstrap-styled web interface.

📊 Model Training & Evaluation:
The following ML models were trained and evaluated on the dataset:

RandomForestClassifier,
AdaBoostClassifier,
GradientBoostingClassifier,
LogisticRegression,
Support Vector Classifier (SVC),
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
DecisionTreeClassifier,
Gaussian Naive Bayes,
XGBoostClassifier.

Each model was evaluated using:
